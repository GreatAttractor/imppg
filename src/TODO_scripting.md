- don't use `std::vector<c_Image>` of 1 or 3 elements for storing channels; wrap in a class enforcing this
- flash the window or sth on script completion
- Add some "print-to-imppg's console" functionality. Consider io.output() (with ImPPG providing a file descriptor). Then use it in all API examples instead of just `print`.
- CPU&bmp backend processor does not apply precise tone curve values?
- translate all scripting error messages
- add lua package info to READMEs
- `save`: assume some default output format from just the extension (e.g., BMP i 8 bpp, TIFF is 16 bpp, FITS 32f etc.)
- FIXME: if there's an error in `c_ImageAlignmentWorkerThread::PhaseCorrelationAlignment` when checking file sizes, user gets on indication
- `imppg.progress` shall also accept real numbers
- for automatic RGB alignment of planets, check if just matching channels' centroids works
- support `?` wildcard in file path masks
