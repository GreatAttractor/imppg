- flash the window or sth on script completion
- Add some "print-to-imppg's console" functionality. Consider io.output() (with ImPPG providing a file descriptor). Then use it in all API examples instead of just `print`.
- CPU&bmp backend processor does not apply precise tone curve values?
- translate all scripting error messages
- add lua package info to READMEs
- fix histogram calculation; currently can overblow green in case of split/process/recombine
- `save`: assume some default output format from just the extension (e.g., BMP i 8 bpp, TIFF is 16 bpp, FITS 32f etc.)
- FIXME: if there's an error in `c_ImageAlignmentWorkerThread::PhaseCorrelationAlignment` when checking file sizes, user gets on indication
